<div data-sal="slide-up" data-sal-delay="500" data-sal-easing="ease-out-cubic"><p>Mead is honey wine. It’s honey and water fermented by yeast, but it can also be flavored with fruits, spices, grains and/or hops. It’s its own distinct category, somewhere between beer and wine. You’d sip it like a beer, wine, or cider.</p>
<p>Mead is like beer and not like beer; it’s like wine and not like wine. Mead tends to be a bit stronger than beer. Author of  "The Compleat Meadmaker", Ken Schramm points out that one similarity to beer is that mead comes in a variety of substyles.

    <STRONG>“Mead has a tremendous amount of versatility,”</STRONG> Schramm says. “Craft beer opened up the doors for creativity; you can make different styles with different flavors.<strong> Mead has that same flexibility. It also has the same range of things you can add to it: spices, fruits, vegetables</strong> —there’s no limit to how creative people can get with this stuff.”</p>
</div>
<div data-sal="slide-up" data-sal-delay="300" data-sal-easing="ease-out-cubic"><p>But <strong>why should you, in this era of craft brews and mixology marvels, delve into the realms of Mead?</strong>  Picture this: a golden elixir that whispers tales of Viking feasts and medieval banquets, a beverage so versatile that it can be as dry as a desert breeze or as sweet as a lover's embrace. it's a journey through time. Mead connects you to ancient fermentation traditions, inviting adventurous epicureans and curious souls alike to savor its timeless allure. <strong>With each sip, you're transported to a bygone era, embracing the past in a glass. Let the sweet charms of Mead awaken your senses to a taste that transcends generations</strong> .</p>

<div class="left-space">
<div class="block-text" data-sal="slide-up" data-sal-delay="300" data-sal-easing="ease-out-sine"><p>In the <strong>beginning of 2023</strong>, <strong>four of us, the founders of what we now call Yggdrassil Brews,</strong> were pursuing a bachelor's degree in Engineering, and were looking for alternatives to beer, because of it's, well <strong>"bitter as crap" </strong>taste. As avid readers of the past and mythology of various cultures, we quite literally stumbled upon Meads. <strong>A Drink referenced throughout the history in various cultures,</strong> we started pursuing the art of brewing it. </p>

<p>We started learning and brewing our first mead ever, to taste and see how we could develop flavors that will match the taste palette of Indian consumers. We started out because we wanted to introduce a new subculture in India, <strong>one that was a huge part of its culture in the old times.</strong> After a three and half weeks of waiting, our first traditional brew was ready. The result, <strong>IT WAS ALMOST TASTELESS!</strong> It had the sweet notes of honey lingering and the taste of fresh from the tap ferment. We were a little disappointed, since our first expectations were wild, but we realized something. <strong>"This drink could hold any flavor we decide to put in it."</strong> We started to research which flavor combinations people loved, and decided upon an apple flavored Mead. Of course, being Indians, we wanted to add some kick to it, so we used honey infused with cinnamon as a base to ferment. Again, we waited for three weeks, and this time, the Mead tasted <strong> amazing!</strong>
<p>That began our journey in pursuit of flavor combinations that people could love, and we started testing out batches with seasonal fruits, spices and floral herbs that could enhance the feel of the mead, <strong>and managed to make a few bottle bombs in between</strong> , but they were worth it! We also played around with coffee, a variety of Mulberry which we couldn't find again, sadly, and a lot of other flavors, and decided upon six to start out with, and then expand! </p>

<br>
In the Vedas, the juice of Soma was extracted by stone grinding or cooked with grains such as barley (yava), milk (go) or curds (dadhi). Soma was often used with ghee (ghrita) and honey (madhu) and <strong>soma was often called madhu (honey or mead). .</strong></p> <br>
<p><strong>In Norse mythology,</strong> mead takes center stage with the creation of the Mead of Poetry or Mead of Inspiration. This magical elixir, crafted from the blood of the wise being Kvasir mixed with honey, imparts poetic inspiration and wisdom to those who partake. <br>Disguising himself as a giant, through a series of cunning tricks, Odin seizes the opportunity and drinks the Mead of Poetry, transforming into an eagle to make a swift escape.
    After obtaining the Mead, Odin returns to Asgard, the realm of the gods. He shares the Mead with the other gods and eventually decides to gift it to humanity, <strong>and serves it as a drink to the undead warriors in Valhalla, where Valkyries tend to them.</strong> 
<strong>The Mead of Poetry, through Odin's sacrifice and quest, becomes a source of inspiration for poets, scholars, and those who seek profound wisdom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Welsh mythology </strong>intertwines mead with the story of Ceridwen's cauldron, a vessel brewing a potion of wisdom. Accidentally consumed by Taliesin, the legendary bard, the potion transforms him into the greatest bard in Welsh tradition. This tale symbolizes mead as a conduit for inspiration and profound understanding.
    <br><br>
    
    In <strong>Anglo-Saxon Culture, </strong>mead takes center stage in the concept of the mead-hall. These communal gathering places are depicted in epics like <strong> "Beowulf" as sites of celebration, camaraderie, and feasting. </strong> Mead, often flowing freely, becomes <strong>a symbol of hospitality, shared joy, and community bonding. </strong>
  <br> <br><strong>Ancient Greece used Ambrosia</strong>
    which, although not explicitly mead, was the sustenance of the Greek gods, and is often associated with honey. Some interpretations suggest that this divine substance, <strong>consumed by the gods to maintain their immortality, could be a form of honeyed mead. </strong> The symbolism ties honey to concepts of longevity and divine sustenance.
 <br> <br> <strong> Ancient China:</strong>
    
    Ancient Chinese culture explores mead-like concoctions crafted from honey and herbs. These elixirs are associated with vitality, strength, and even the pursuit of immortality.<strong>Mead, in this context, becomes a bridge between the earthly and the divine,</strong>  connecting individuals to the forces of life and longevity.
  <br> <br> <strong>Medieval Europe:</strong>
    
    Mead in medieval Europe becomes synonymous with celebrations, weddings, and festivities. Its inclusion in rituals like the<strong>"honey-moon," where newlyweds consume mead for a lunar month, underscores its association with fertility and the sweetness of a new union. </strong> The historical mead-hall echoes through literature, embodying the spirit of communal revelry.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>These mythological and historical references collectively depict mead as more than just a beverage. It becomes a thread woven through the fabric of cultures, symbolizing inspiration, wisdom, community, and even a connection to the divine. From Norse sagas to Welsh legends, mead's presence transcends time, embodying the essence of shared experiences, celebration, and the pursuit of knowledge across diverse civilizations.</p>

<div data-sal="slide-up" data-sal-delay="300" data-sal-easing="ease-out-sine"><p>Hyderabad is considered the main pearl trading centre in India, because of which the city is also known as the "City of Pearls". The most notable area devoted to the trade is the village called Chandanpet just outside Hyderabad, wherein almost the entire population is engaged in the delicate art of drilling pearls, a skill they have practiced for generations. This practice also makes the city one of the largest pearl drilling locations in India.</p>
<p>The Golkonda Fort, Charminar, Qutub Shahi Tombs, Chowmahalla Palace, Taj Falaknuma, etc. are some of the countless relics of post renaissance history, that give Hyderabad its characteristic allure.</p>
<p>On the other side, the Hitech City and Financial hubs developed made Hyderabad one of the best IT corridors of India, and has emerged as a truly faultless metropolitan city.</p>
<p>With this historic allure seeped within our minds, we looked deep into the history, and found a beverage that will enhance the subculture of Alcoholic drinks in all the states and India, and we brewed our batches in this city, to enjoy while watching the views from Old City.</p>
